    "- supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data and recognize patterns, used for classification and regression analysis\n",

    "- Given a set of training examples, each marked for belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns a new examples into one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "- An SVM model is a representation of the examples as points in space, mapped so that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clelar gap that is as wide as possible. New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall on\n",

    "- We have many options of hyperplanes that separate perfectly. The question that arises is how do we actually choose the line that separates these classes the best\n",
