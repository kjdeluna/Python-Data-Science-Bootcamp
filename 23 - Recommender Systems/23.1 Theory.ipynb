    "#### Collaborative Filtering (CF)\n",
    "- produces recommendations based on the knowledge of users' attitude to items, that is uses the \"wisdom of the crowd\" to recommend items\n",
    "- based on other people's experience, Amazon suggest items that you will enjoy\n",
    "- is more commonly useed than content-based systems because it usually gives better results and is relatively easy to understand (from an overall implementation perspective)\n",
    "- the algorithm has the ability to do feature learning on its own, which means that it can start to learn for itself what features to use\n",
